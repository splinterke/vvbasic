<body>
<h2>REPEAT, ENDREPEAT, and BREAK</h2>

Code between <tt>REPEAT</tt> and <tt>ENDREPEAT</tt> can be
executed multiple times.
Starting right after the <tt>REPEAT</tt>, each command is
executed, and after the last command before the <tt>ENDREPEAT</tt>,
the computer goes back to the first command in the
<tt>REPEAT</tt> - <tt>ENDREPEAT</tt> "block."
Commands like this that can be executed repeatedly are sometimes
called a <i>loop</i>.
IF a <tt>BREAK</tt> command is executed, then the computer goes
straight to the command after the <tt>ENDREPEAT</tt>.
Here are several examples:

<p>
Notice that in every example the <tt>BREAK</tt> command is
inside an <tt>IF</tt>.  That makes sense, because if the
<tt>BREAK</tt> were not in an <tt>IF</tt> it would be
executed on the first time through the loop, and there
would be no repetition.
<tt>BREAK</tt>s are almost always found inside an <tt>IF</tt>
command. (And also inside a <tt>REPEAT</tt> - <tt>ENDREPEAT</tt>
block -- it is an error to use <tt>BREAK</tt> anywhere else.)

<p>
Also notice that the lines between <tt>REPEAT</tt> and
<tt>ENDREPEAT</tt> are indented.  This is not required by
the computer, but it is extremely helpful for making the
program readable.

<P>
The third example above has one
<tt>REPEAT</tt> - <tt>ENDREPEAT</tt> within another.
Each loop has its own <tt>BREAK</tt>.
The outer loop is executed once for each time the
game is played, and the inner loop is executed once
for each guess the player makes.
Study this program carefully and make sure you
understand it.
