<h2>NUMBER and TEXT</h2>

VVBasic allows you to create <b>variables</b> and give them values.
A variable is a name for either a number or a text string.
Here are some examples:

<P>
<table border cellpadding=2>
<th>VVBasic commands <th>Output
<tr>	<td><tt>NUMBER age = 12<br>
				TEXT name = "Sue"<br>
				PRINT "The age of " name " is " age&nbsp;</tt>
		<td><tt>The age of Sue is 12&nbsp;</tt>
</table>

<P>
The first two lines of this little VVBasic program create
two variables.  The variable <tt>age</tt> is a number with
the value <tt>12</tt> and the variable <tt>name</tt> is a text string
which has the value <tt>Sue</tt>.
The PRINT command on the third line displays
<tt>The age of Sue is 12</tt>. In a PRINT command,
a variable is replaced by its value, so the computer replaces
<tt>name</tt> with <tt>Sue</tt> and <tt>age</tt> with <tt>12</tt>.

<p>

Variable names must begin with a letter, and can only be made of
letters, numbers, and the underline character _.  Here are some
examples of good and bad variable names:

<p>
<center>
<table border cellpadding=5>
<th>Good <th>Bad
<tr>	<td><tt>AGE</tt>	<td><tt>1DERFUL</tt>
<tr>	<td><tt>Choice</tt>				<td><tt>User'sChoice</tt>
<tr>	<td><tt>DAY_OF_WEEK</tt>				<td><tt>DAY OF WEEK</tt>
<tr>	<td><tt>FavoriteColor</tt>		<td><tt>Favorite-Color</tt>
</table>
</center>

<P>
Text variables can only contain text strings,
and number variables can only contain numbers.
A variable can be created without a value, as in these examples:

<P>
<table border cellpadding=2>
<th>VVBasic commands
<tr>	<td><tt>NUMBER item_price&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>
<tr>	<td><tt>TEXT item_name</tt>
</table>

<P>If a variable does not have a value, it must be given
one with a LET command or an INPUT command before it is printed.
