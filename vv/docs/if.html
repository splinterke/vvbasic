<h2>IF, THEN, ELSE, ENDIF</h2>

The IF command is used to execute one or more other commands only
if some test is true.  For example:

<p>
<table border cellpadding=2>
<th>VVBasic commands <th>Output
<tr>	<td><tt>
            NUMBER A = 12<br>
            NUMBER B = 7<br>
            IF A > B THEN<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINT "A is greater than B"&nbsp;<br>
            ENDIF<br>
            PRINT "Hello"
            </tt>
		<td><tt>A is greater than B&nbsp;<br>
				Hello</tt>
<tr>	<td><tt>
            NUMBER A = 12<br>
            NUMBER B = 107<br>
            IF A > B THEN<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINT "A is greater than B"<br>
            ENDIF<br>
            PRINT "Hello"
            </tt>
		<td><tt>Hello</tt>
</table>
<p>
In the above examples, the test is whether the value in
variable A is greater than the value in variable B.
In the first example, this is true, and the <tt>PRINT</tt> statement
inside the <tt>IF</tt> - <tt>ENDIF</tt> block is executed.
In the second example, the test <tt>A &gt; B</tt> is not
true, and the <tt>PRINT</tt> statement is skipped.
In both cases the second <tt>PRINT</tt> is executed, since
it is outside the control of the <tt>IF</tt>.

<P>
An <tt>IF</tt> statement can also have an <tt>ELSE</tt> part,
which is executed if the test is not true.
<p>
<table border cellpadding=2>
<th>VVBasic commands <th>Output
<tr>	<td><tt>
            TEXT Name = "Bill"<br>
            IF Name = "Bill" THEN<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINT "Hi, Bill!"<br>
            ELSE<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LET OtherCount = OtherCount + 1&nbsp;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINT "What's your name?"<br>
            ENDIF<br>
            PRINT "Please enter."
            </tt>
		<td><tt>Hi, Bill!<br>
				Please enter.</tt>
<tr>	<td><tt>
            TEXT Name = "Sandy"<br>
            IF Name = "Bill" THEN<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINT "Hi, Bill!"<br>
            ELSE<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LET OtherCount = OtherCount + 1&nbsp;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINT "What's your name?"<br>
            ENDIF<br>
            PRINT "Please enter."
            </tt>
		<td><tt>What's your name?<br>
				Please enter.</tt>
</table>
<p>

In this example, the test checks whether two text strings are equal.
If they are (as in the first case), the first <tt>PRINT</tt> is executed.
If they aren't (as in the second case), then the <tt>LET</tt> and
the second <tt>PRINT</tt> are is executed.

<P>
Note that with every <tt>IF</tt> command, there is always
one <tt>THEN</tt>, optionally one <tt>ELSE</tt>, and finally
an <tt>ENDIF</tt>.  Any number of VVBasic statements can be
placed after the <tt>THEN</tt> and after the <tt>ELSE</tt>.
You can even put an <tt>IF</tt> inside another <tt>IF</tt>,
as in this example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=2>
<th>VVBasic commands <th>Output
<tr>	<td><tt>
			REM Compare two prices.<br>
			NUMBER Price1<br>
			NUMBER Price2<br>
			INPUT "Price #1: " Price1, "Price #2: " Price2<br>
            IF Price1 = Price2 THEN<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IF PRICE1 = 0 THEN<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINT "Equal, both 0."<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ELSE<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINT "Equal, not 0."<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENDIF<br>
            ELSE<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IF PRICE1 < PRICE2 THEN<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINT "Price 1 is less."<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ELSE<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINT "Price 2 is less."<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENDIF<br>
            ENDIF<br>
            PRINT "All Done."
            </tt>
		<td>(Assume the user entered 10.99 for Price 1 and 16.50 for Price 2.)
		    <br>&nbsp;<br>
		    <tt>Price 1 is less.<br>
				All Done</tt>
</table>
<p>
Notice how in this program the code has been indented so that the
<tt>IF</tt>, <tt>ELSE</tt>, and <tt>ENDIF</tt> that go with each other
start in the same column.  This makes the code much easier to
understand.

<h3>The IF's test</h3>

Every<tt>IF</tt> has a test to determine whether some commands are
executed or not.
The test has to be something which is true or false.
For instance, <tt>A < B</tt> is a good test because it is
true or false.  You cannot use <tt>103</tt> or <tt>"stomach"</tt>
as <tt>IF</tt> tests, because those are number or string
values.
Good <tt>IF</tt> tests are made using comparison operators,
shown in the following table.
<p>
<table border cellpadding=2>
<th>Operator <th>Name		<th>Example
<tr>	<td><tt>=</tt>		<td>equals	<td><tt>IF A = 2 * B THEN</tt>
<tr>	<td><tt> < </tt>	<td>less than	<td><tt>IF C / 2 < D + 4 THEN</tt>
<tr>	<td><tt> <= </tt>	<td>less than or equal	<td><tt>IF COST <= 10.00 THEN</tt>
<tr>	<td><tt> >  </tt>	<td>greater than	<td><tt>IF X > Y THEN</tt>
<tr>	<td><tt> >= </tt>	<td>greater than or equal&nbsp;
											<td><tt>IF Round(A,2) >= A THEN&nbsp;</tt>
<tr>	<td><tt> <> </tt>	<td>not equals	<td><tt>IF AGE <> 18 THEN</tt>
</table>
<P>
The operators in the table above can be used to compare
text strings as well as numbers.
When two strings are compared, the one that is "less" is
the one that would come first in the dictionary.
<P>
More complex tests can be made by constructing simpler tests
with <tt>AND</tt> and <tt>OR</tt>.
When two tests are combined with <tt>AND</tt>,
then <i>both</i> tests have to be true for the entire combined
test to be true.
When two tests are combined with <tt>OR</tt>,
then <i>either one</i> of the two tests (or both of them)
has to be true for the entire combined test to be true.
Here are some examples:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=2>
<th>VVBasic commands <th>Output
<tr>	<td><tt>
            NUMBER A = 12<br>
            NUMBER B = 7<br>
            NUMBER C = 9<br>
            IF A > B AND B > C THEN<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINT "A > B and B > C"&nbsp;<br>
            ELSE<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINT "Not in order"<br>
            ENDIF<br>
            </tt>
		<td><tt>Not in order&nbsp;<br>
		    </tt>
<tr>	<td><tt>
            NUMBER A = 10<br>
            NUMBER B = 5<br>
            NUMBER C = 20<br>
            IF A < B OR A < C THEN<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINT "A not the biggest"&nbsp;<br>
            ELSE<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINT "A is the biggest"<br>
            ENDIF<br>
            </tt>
		<td><tt>A not the biggest&nbsp;</tt>
</table>
