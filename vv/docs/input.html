<h2>INPUT</h2>

The <tt>INPUT</tt> command is used to ask the user to enter
information.
The information the user enters becomes the value of
one or more variables.
When the <tt>INPUT</tt> command executes, a dialog
box appears, as in the following example:

<p>
<table border cellpadding=2>
<th>VVBasic commands <th>Dialog Box
<tr>	<td><tt>TEXT Name <br>
				INPUT "Enter your name" Name</tt>
		<td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<img src="input1.gif">&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
<tr>	<td><tt>TEXT Name <br>
                NUMBER Age = 12 <br>
                TEXT Food = "Pizza" <br>
                INPUT "Enter your name" Name, <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enter your age" Age, <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enter your favorite food" Food &nbsp;<br>
				</tt>
		<td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<img src="input2.gif">&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
</table>
<p>

In the first example above, if the user types <tt>Mary</tt>
into the text area and clicks on the OK button, then the
variable <tt>Name</tt> will have the value "Mary".
If the user clicks on the Cancel button, the program stops.
<p>
The second example shows that the user can be asked for
more than one value.
The command <tt>INPUT</tt> is followed by a "prompt string"
in quotation marks, and then a variable name.
Multiple prompts and variables can be given, separated by
commas.
If a variable already has a value
(for example, the value of <tt>Age</tt> is <tt>12</tt>), then
that value shows up in the text field.

<p>
Unless Cancel is selected, the <tt>INPUT</tt> command also
prints an "echo" of the prompts and the values entered in the Output window.
For example, with the second example above, the following
might be printed:
<pre>
          Enter your name Mike
          Enter your age 15
          Enter your favorite food Scrambled eggs
</pre>

<p>
The computer makes sure that no input fields are left
blank, and that numeric variables such as <tt>Age</tt>
have numbers entered, and not text.
In the next examples, the user pressed OK with nothing
entered for name (in the first case), and with a
non-numeric value for age (in the second case).
The computer put a message in the upper left of the
dialog box.

<p>
<table border cellpadding=2>
<th>VVBasic commands <th>Dialog Box
<tr>	<td><tt>TEXT Name <br>
				INPUT "Enter your name" Name</tt>
		<td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<img src="input1a.gif">&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
<tr>	<td><tt>TEXT Name <br>
                NUMBER Age = 12 <br>
                TEXT Food = "Pizza" <br>
                INPUT "Enter your name" Name, <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enter your age" Age, <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enter your favorite food" Food &nbsp;<br>
				</tt>
		<td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<img src="input2a.gif">&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
</table>
<p>

<h2>When and Complain</h2>

The programmer often needs to make sure that values entered
in an <tt>INPUT</tt> are <i>valid</i>.
A valid value is one that makes sense.
For instance, a value for <tt>Age</tt> can't be negative
and can't be greater than 110.
To test whether a value is valid and give the user a message
if it isn't, <tt>INPUT</tt> commands can have
<tt>WHEN</tt> and <tt>COMPLAIN</tt> parts.
Here are two examples:

<p>
<table border cellpadding=2>
<th>VVBasic commands <th>Dialog Box
<tr>	<td><tt>TEXT Name <br>
				INPUT "Enter your name" Name<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEN Length(Name) < 2<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMPLAIN "That's too short!"<br>
				</tt>
		<td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<img src="input1b.gif">&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
<tr>	<td><tt>TEXT Name <br>
                NUMBER Age = 12 <br>
                TEXT Food = "Pizza" <br>
                INPUT "Enter your name" Name, <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enter your age" Age, <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enter your favorite food" Food &nbsp;<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEN Age < 0<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMPLAIN "Age can't be negative."<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEN Age = 0<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMPLAIN "Age can't be zero."<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEN Age > 110<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMPLAIN "You can't be that old."&nbsp;<br>
				</tt>
		<td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<img src="input2b.gif">&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
</table>
<p>

In the first <tt>INPUT</tt> example,
the user typed in <tt>M</tt> for <tt>Name</tt>.
The <tt>WHEN</tt> uses the <tt>Length</tt> function to determine
the length of the text string in the <tt>Name</tt> variable.
The length is 1, which is less than 2, so the <tt>WHEN</tt>'s
test is true, and the text following <tt>COMPLAIN</tt> is
displayed at the top of the dialog box.
<p>
In the second <tt>INPUT</tt> example,
the user has entered <tt>-5</tt> for <tt>Age</tt>.
Since -5 is less than 0,
the first <tt>WHEN</tt> test is true, and the
corresponding <tt>COMPLAIN</tt> text is put in the dialog box.

<P>
One <tt>WHEN</tt> and one <tt>COMPLAIN</tt> always go together.
After the <tt>WHEN</tt> is a test (such as Age = 0) that can
be true or false.
If the test is false, nothing happens.
If the test is true, then the text after the
<tt>COMPLAIN</tt> is put in the dialog box.
If an <tt>INPUT</tt> has more than one <tt>WHEN</tt>-<tt>COMPLAIN</tt>
pairs, it looks at them in order, and "complains" when the first
<tt>WHEN</tt> test is true.
Note that <tt>WHEN</tt> and <tt>COMPLAIN</tt> can only be used
as part of an <tt>INPUT</tt> command.

<h2>The NOECHO option</h2>

As mentioned above, <tt>INPUT</tt> usually "echoes" the
each prompt and value entered.  This can be stopped by
putting <tt>NOECHO</tt> immediately after <tt>INPUT</tt>,
as in this example:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=2>
<th>VVBasic commands <th>Dialog Box
<tr>	<td><tt>TEXT Name <br>
				INPUT NOECHO "Enter your name" Name &nbsp;</tt>
		<td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<img src="input1.gif">&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
		(no change to the dialog box)
</table>
