<h2>PRINT</h2>

Use the <tt>PRINT</tt> command to make the computer display something in the output window.
(PRINT in VVBasic does not mean putting ink on paper.)
Here are some examples using PRINT:
<p>
<table border cellpadding=2>
<th>VVBasic commands <th>Output
<tr>	<td><tt>PRINT "I am a computer."</tt>	<td><tt>I am a computer.</tt>
<tr>	<td><tt>PRINT 2 + 3</tt>				<td><tt>5</tt>
<tr>	<td><tt>PRINT "2 + 3"</tt>				<td><tt>2 + 3</tt>
<tr>	<td><tt>PRINT "2 + 3 = " 2 + 3</tt>		<td><tt>2 + 3 = 5</tt>
</table>
<p>
In the first example, notice that <tt>"I am a computer."</tt>
has quotation marks around it.
(Make sure you press the shift key to type a quotation mark.
You can't type two apostrophes.)
Anything typed in between two
quotation marks is called a <b>text string</b>, or just <b>text</b>,
or just a <b>string</b>.  When you tell the computer to print a
text string, the computer prints it out exactly as you typed it,
without the surrounding quotation marks.

<p>

In the second example, the computer displays <tt>5</tt>, since
five is the sum of two plus three.  When the computer sees a
math operation symbol such as + (plus), - (minus), * (use an
asterisk for multiplication), or / (use a slash for divide),
it does the calculation before printing out the result.

<p>

In the third example, the computer displays <tt>2 + 3</tt>.
It doesn’t do the addition, because the quotation marks
around <tt>"2 + 3"</tt> tell the computer to print out the
text string exactly as it is.

<p>

In the fourth example, the computer prints <tt>2 + 3 = 5</tt>.
It prints out <tt>2 + 3 =</tt> because that text string is in
quotation marks.  It prints out <tt>5</tt> because five is the
sum of two and three.   Being able to mix text strings and
arithmetic is very useful.

<p>

You can use a comma in a PRINT command to line items up in columns.
Each comma tells the PRINT command to start a new column.
For instance, here is a two line
program and its output:
<p>

<table border cellpadding=2>
<th>VVBasic commands <th>Output
<tr>	<td><tt>PRINT "Cost of a telephone:", 24.95 <br>
				PRINT "Cost of a car:", 19995.00</tt>
		<td><tt>Cost of a telephone:&nbsp;&nbsp;24.95 <br>
				Cost of a car:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19995.00</tt>
</table>

<h2>CLEAR</h2>

A useful VVBasic command is CLEAR.  This command clears the
output window.  Many programmers like to put a CLEAR command
at the start of every program.
