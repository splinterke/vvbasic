<h2>LET</h2>

The value of a variable can be changed using LET.  Some examples:
<P>
<table border cellpadding=2>
<th>VVBasic commands <th>Output
<tr>	<td><tt>NUMBER height<br>
				TEXT name = "Denver"<br>
				LET height = 5280<br>
				PRINT "The height of " name " is " height&nbsp;<br>
				LET height = (40 + 300) / (20 - 3)<br>
				LET name = "Albany"<br>
				PRINT "The height of " name " is " height<br>
			</tt>
		<td><tt>	The height of Denver is 5280&nbsp; <br>
					The height of Albany is 20
			</tt>
</table>

<p>
A LET command always has four parts:
<OL>
<LI> <tt>LET</tt>
<LI> the variable name
<LI> the equals sign
<LI> the value assigned to the variable.
</OL>
<P>

It is often useful to give a variable a new value based on its old value.
<P>

<table border cellpadding=2>
<th>VVBasic commands <th>Output
<tr>	<td><tt>NUMBER MarksAge = 12<br>
				PRINT "Mark is now " MarksAge<br>
				LET MarksAge = MarksAge + 1<br>
				PRINT "On his next birthday he'll be " MarksAge&nbsp;<br>
			</tt>
		<td><tt>	Mark is now 12 <br>
					On his next birthday he'll be 13 &nbsp;
			</tt>
</table>

<P>

Notice that on the third line of this program, 1 was added to
<tt>MarksAge</tt>, changing the value of <tt>MarksAge</tt>,

<P>
VVBasic doesn't care whether the letters in variable names
are upper case or lower case.  The following program is hard
to read, but works fine:
<P>

<table border cellpadding=2>
<th>VVBasic commands <th>Output
<tr>	<td><tt>NUMBER Distance<br>
				LET distance = 1000<br>
				LET DISTANCE = disTance * 2<br>
				PRINT "Distance is " dIsTaNCE&nbsp;
			</tt>
		<td><tt>	Distance is 2000 &nbsp;<br>
			</tt>
</table>
<P>
In this program, <tt>Distance</tt>, <tt>distance</tt>,<tt>DISTANCE</tt>,
and <tt>dIsTaNCE</tt> are all names for the same variable.
<P>
However, VVBasic is <it>very</it> picky that you spell a variable
in the same way every time you use it.
The following program will not run -- can you see why?
<P>

<table border cellpadding=2>
<th>VVBasic commands <th>Output
<tr>	<td><tt>NUMBER DistanceToTheirHouse = 100<br>
				PRINT "Distance is " DistanceToThereHouse&nbsp;
			</tt>
		<td><tt>	<font color=red>Nothing printed!</font>&nbsp;
			</tt>
</table>
